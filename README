The original fastqc (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is a java program that reads genomic fastq files and does various quality control (QC) checks and graphs. This fastqc project is an R package that does much the same (the results are near identical). 

At base it uses the seqan library (http://www.seqan.de) - "an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences". This is interfaced with R using the Rcpp package plus I use RcppArmadillo too for matrix calculations. Then for graphics I use ggplot2.

Whilst the original fastqc (java) reads ~200k reads only. This program will read everything. So whilst fairly efficient in memory and speed it maybe make your 4GB laptop chunter if you push past the ~4-5 million read mark.

This is an experimental package..Future work includes multi-file support with multithreading.
